#Welcome to My D&D Notes Haven

Hey there, fellow adventurers! You've stumbled upon a treasure trove of D&D wisdom, or at least that's what I'm trying to convince myself of.

#The Not-So-Noteworthy Note Taker

First off, let me share a little secret - my players never take notes. Yep, you heard it right! So, if you're here expecting beautifully transcribed epic tales, well, you might be in the wrong dungeon. But, don't worry, I've got some scribbles and scrolls that might tickle your fancy.

#Four Years and Counting...

Now, you might wonder, "How seasoned is this dungeon master?" Well, I've been rolling dice and slaying imaginary dragons for over four years. And in case you're wondering, the low number of sessions on this website is totally due to scheduling conflicts, not because I'm secretly procrastinating on my D&D duties. Nope, not at all.

#Errors, Contributions, and Love Letters

I'm not perfect, and neither are my notes. If you spot an error, a plot hole big enough to ride a dragon through, or you just want to contribute your two copper pieces, feel free to send a raven... I mean, an [email](mailto:steefvdpouw@hotmail.com). Seriously, I'd love to hear from you.
