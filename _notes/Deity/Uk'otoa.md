Uk'otoa was created by [[Zehir]] and terrorized the seas of [[Wildemount]] until the [[Divergence]] left the leviathan without master or purpose. The surviving indigenous people of the [[Swavain Islands]], the [[Ki'Nau]], took Uk'otoa as their guide and god to rule the waters and bring them prosperity. The leviathan elevated the [[Ki'Nau]] to concquer the southern coasts of the continent until the jealous will of [[Zehir]] reached beyond the [[Divine Gate]] and discovered the insolence of his creation, commanding his followers to seal away Uk'otoa in the bedrock beneath the [[Lucidian Ocean]]. Rumor has it that these followers have used several crystals as bindings to hold Uk'otoa captive.
