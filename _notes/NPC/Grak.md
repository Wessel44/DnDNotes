[[Grak]] and [[Urga]] were a devoted orc couple living in the harsh lands of [[Xhorhas]] in Wildmount. As members of an orcish clan, they faced countless struggles and battles, but they were determined to create a better future for themselves and their two young children.

One fateful day, [[Grak]] and [[Urga]] came across whispers of an enchanted island called [[Rumblecusp]], where a deity known as [[Vokodo]] was said to grant purpose and fulfillment to those who sought it. Intrigued by the possibility of finding a greater meaning in life, the couple decided to embark on a perilous journey to this mysterious island.

After a treacherous voyage across treacherous seas, [[Grak]] and [[Urga]] arrived on the shores of [[Rumblecusp]]. However, their arrival was accompanied by a strange occurrence. A powerful enchantment veiled their memories, casting a fog over their past and leaving them disoriented and confused.

Unbeknownst to them, their children were also taken away from them during their arrival. The circumstances surrounding this separation remain shrouded in mystery, lost in the haze of their forgotten memories. [[Grak]] and [[Urga]] find themselves heartbroken and desperate to reunite with their beloved offspring, but they lack the knowledge of their children's whereabouts.
