Protectors of the [[Temple of the False Serpent]]

The physical appearance of the Yuan-ti can vary from individual to individual, some have heads that are full of serpent features, patches of scales, yellow eyes. Some have even developed snake-like tails where their limbs would be. The Yuan-ti have built a village around the temple. They dress in simple attire suitable for the jungle environment and shun hoods so both members of their society and trespassers are easily identifiable.
