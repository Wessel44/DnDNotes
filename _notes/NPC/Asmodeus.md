**Asmodeus, the Lord of the [[Nine Hells]]** is the devil god of the [[Nine Hells]] and represents mastery of tyranny and domination. He relishes in corrupting mortal souls with his honeyed words. He rules his domain with an iron fist and the punishments he inflicts for crossing him are legendary. Devils and other evil entities pay him tribute, while warlocks are drawn to his power.
