Parents: [[Grak]] & [[Urga]]
Sibling: [[Grom]]


[[Grak]] and [[Urga]]'s children were the light of their lives, bringing joy and hope to their orcish family. Their son, [[Grom]], was a young orc with a curious and adventurous spirit. He possessed a natural talent for hunting and survival, eager to explore the world around him. [[Grom]]'s boundless energy and mischievous nature often kept [[Grak]] and [[Urga]] on their toes.

Their daughter, [[Zara]], was a gentle and compassionate soul. She possessed a deep connection to nature, demonstrating a unique affinity for animals and plants. [[Zara]] had a serene presence, soothing those around her with her kind words and nurturing nature. Her ability to find beauty in the simplest things brought solace and tranquility to their family.

Both [[Grom]] and [[Zara]] were too young to comprehend the complexities of their parents' journey to Rumblecusp. Unfortunately, they were tragically separated from [[Grak]] and [[Urga]] upon their arrival, their memories torn asunder by the island's enchantment. Their fate remains unknown, leaving [[Grak]] and [[Urga]] with a fervent desire to reunite their family and restore the bond that was stolen from them.
