Female Gnome Warlock

Mysteriously dissapeared after the encounter with the [[Goblin King]] in [[Cragmaw Hideout]]

Has (had) a pet capybara named [[Gululu]] who resided in her magical [[Chibi's Hot-Pot Pot]].

She is very artistic and always had her own paint supplies with her.

Apparently had dealings with the [[Tyrkas]] family. Found a note on [[Whysp Isle]] containing orders given by Chibi towards [[Jaris Tyrkas]].
