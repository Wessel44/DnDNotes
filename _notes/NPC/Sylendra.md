[[Krekhet]]'s dad 
[[Argoth]]'s wife
Formerly [[Lythier]]

In the plane of the [[Nine Hells]], amidst the fiery depths of [[Avernus]], two dragonborn parents, [[Argoth]] and [[Sylendra]], lived a treacherous existence. Bound by their heritage and seeking power and influence, they delved into dark arts and made a fateful pact with a devil, whose name was lost in the haze of time. This pact promised them great rewards and elevated status, but it came with a sinister condition.

Driven by their ambitions, [[Argoth]] and [[Sylendra]] agreed to deliver a specific artifact named [[Soulshard Amulet]] to the devil [[Mealrok]] within a given timeframe. Failure to fulfill this condition would result in dire consequences. However, as time passed, the burden of their obligations grew heavy, and they found themselves unable to locate the artifact or meet the devil's demands.

[[Mealrok]], true to his word, sought retribution for the broken pact. Enraged by [[Argoth]] and [[Sylendra]]'s failure, the devil devised a cruel punishment: to snatch away their only young son, [[Krekhet]]. Consumed by despair and anguish, the dragonborn parents were rendered powerless as [[Mealrok]] erased their memories of the child's existence, leaving them with a void in their hearts they couldn't comprehend.

To carry out [[Mealrok]]'s punishment, the malevolent entity conspired with a powerful deity known as [[Vokodo]]. [[Vokodo]], an enigmatic and inscrutable force, resided on the mysterious Island of [[Rumblecusp]]—a place enveloped in a shroud of arcane energies and forgotten memories. Entrusting the fate of [[Krekhet]] to [[Vokodo]]'s care, [[Mealrok]] handed over the disoriented and memory-wiped [[Argoth]] and [[Sylendra]] to the deity's island, where their lives would take an unexpected turn.

On the Island of [[Rumblecusp]], the dragonborn couple found themselves in a world far removed from the hellscape they once knew. Surrounded by lush vegetation, pristine beaches, and a tranquil atmosphere, they struggled to comprehend their sudden change in environment. Unbeknownst to them, [[Vokodo]], in his divine wisdom, sought to guide [[Argoth]] and [[Sylendra]] toward redemption and self-discovery, offering them an opportunity for salvation from their past misdeeds. 

Stripped of their memories, the couple embarked on a new journey—a chance to rebuild their lives, find solace, and perhaps even uncover the truth about their forgotten son. As they settled into this peaceful island, [[Argoth]] and [[Sylendra]] felt a persistent longing deep within their hearts, a subconscious yearning for something they could not remember. Dreams and fragments of their past occasionally haunted their sleep, leaving them with a sense of unease and a lingering need for answers.

Guided by [[Vokodo]]'s subtle influence and the whispers of their lost memories, [[Argoth]] and [[Sylendra]] now tread a delicate path. They are compelled to uncover the truth behind their forgotten son and the circumstances that led them to this uncharted island. As they explore [[Rumblecusp]], they may encounter fellow adventurers whose destinies have also been shaped by [[Vokodo]]'s intervention, unknowingly bound by a shared journey towards redemption, family reunion, and the resolution of the dark debts of their past.

Need to return to the [[Nine Hells]]:

Soul Debt: Within the terms of their pact, [[Argoth]] and [[Sylendra]] unknowingly agreed to offer their souls to [[Mealrok]] upon completion of their task or at a specified time. This unfulfilled debt hangs over them, creating a constant connection between their souls and the devil. Their souls act as a conduit, allowing [[Mealrok]] to maintain influence and control over their actions. 
After [[Vokodo]] was done with them, their souls would be [[Mealrok]]'s. He is probably looking to collect.
