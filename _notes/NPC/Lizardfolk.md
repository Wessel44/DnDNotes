Inhabitants of [[Urukayxl]].

The **lizardfolk** live on the outskirts of the island. They call the rivers, streams and the inlets home. They speak in a very low, guttural clicking. They're muscular, and burly, hunched, and they are deeply scaled all over. They have long snouts with rows of sharp teeth and a frill down the back of the neck.

They wear makeshift bits of leather strapped together to form patches of armor across the torso, and big heavy shields, carved from a large shell, that have multiple rows of spines and hooks down the back. They carry clubs and heavy blades that are made of makeshift, scavenged metal or weapons that have washed up on shore or have been recovered from others that have been unlucky to make their way to this island and never returned
