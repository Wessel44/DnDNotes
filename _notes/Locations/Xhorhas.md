**Xhorhas**, sometimes referred to as **the Wastes of Xhorhas**, is a large region spreading across the expansive wastes and turbulent badlands of eastern [[Wynandir]] in [[Wildemount]]. It includes multiple regions, governments, tribes, and loose confederations, but is dominated by the [[Kryn Dynasty]], whose capital is the dark city of [[Rosohna]]


Xhorhas is smaller than the [[Dwendalian empire]] and has few natural resources. It is a scarred landscape overrun with beasts and terrors left over from [[the Calamity]] . The Xhorhasians are derogatorily referred to by the Dwendalians as "cricks" (short for "crickets"), due to the holes that are cut into Xhorhasian armor, causing the armor to produce a chirping sound as the troops charge forward.

The northern lands of Xhorhas are ruled by the [[Kryn Dynasty]]. Its capital [[Rosohna]] was built in the ruins of [[Ghor Dranas]], a former city of the [[Betrayer Gods]] during [[the Calamity]]. The Dynasty is ruled by the [[Empress Leylas Kryn]].

The southern portions of Xhorhas consist of marshes, dense forests, and grasslands.
