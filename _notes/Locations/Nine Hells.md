The Nine Hells of Baator, more commonly known as simply the Nine Hells, is the home plane of the devils.

It is a plane of evil and, unlike the [[Abyss]], is highly organized with a strict caste system, each devil kneeling before those who are above them in hierarchy: lemures, lesser devils, greater devils (e.g. pit fiends), and archdevils who in turn all owe their fealty to [[Asmodeus]].
