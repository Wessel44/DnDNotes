[[Port Damali]] is the largest and westernmost of the city-states on the [[Menagerie Coast]], being the major hub of trade between all the western bits of civilization including [[Tal'dorei]], [[Marquet]], and [[Issylra]]. It has a strong connection with the [[Myriad]], to the point that they allegedly run the city. Though "most anything is legal" in [[Port Damali]], it is still a member of the [[Clovis Concord]].
