The Astral Plane is one of the boundary planes that lie between many of the other realms. It is an amorphous realm where the will and the imagination have influence over the surrounding space, where one can will oneself to float and move. Some creatures whose species have been there for a long time have learned to actually shape the amorphous matter and energy into structures and objects. They therefore tend to be very psychic-oriented.
